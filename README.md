,`*DOMAIN QUESTIONNAIRE*`,

1. List 10 available domains (use http://iwantmyname.com) you think would be appropriate for your site:

nycsubwayvinyl.club
nycsubwayvinyl.dance
subwayvinyl.nyc
subwayvinyl.party
subwayvinyl.kitchen
subwaybeat.builders
subwaybeat.fm
subway.haus
subwayfloor.haus
subwayfloormusic.nyc


2. What type or genre of domain is this? (Ex. Game, Toy, Greeting Card Generator, Creative Tool, Political Pamphlet, Archive)

It is a creative tool combining both simple visual and music compostion
  
3. Write a small story (one paragraph or so) that details a user's experience of discovering your domain, visiting it within a particular context (like mobile, desktop, while hungry, at a funeral, etc.), experiencing what it has to offer, and subsequently leaving.

The user would be introduced either by word of mouth unless otherwise advertised and enter the website alone, unknowing of that what they are about to play with is essentially a music tool. The user is introduced to the editable subway floor image with five parameters. The user will create a visually pleasing image and then save it to their collection. The user may check their collection and then realise they make create a greater variety of subway floor designs. Once they have created their preffered combinations they may, out of curiosity, click on the vinyl tab. This will then direct them to a page where a beat processor will be placed next to their collection of subway floors. The user will click and drag to fill up the beat processor with their images. The user will then press play and either enjoy their beat or begin to spend time perfecting their composition. The user will then go back and forth between the look of the subway floor image and the beat processor to come up with new musical compositions. Once they have spent too much time on the site bouncing in their chair, they will send the link to a friend and wait for their creation. 
  
4. Would somebody return to your domain after visiting it for the first time - in how long do you think - and why?

The return rate to the website would be frequent after the first visit; however, it may slow down once the user has possibly created a satisfying amount of arrangements, both visually and musically.
  
5. List some 'stuff' that your site 'does'. (Be detailed)

The site allows the user to edit create their own subway floor color combinations and save each one individually. The user is unaware that each parameter that is changed for the colours of the subway floor edits a second set of parameters. Once the user has created a set of subway floor combinations, they mave access to the beat processor in which they may use each one of their subway floor creations as a sound. The user then places the subway floors combinations into the beat processor and may compose a musical piece. The user has the ability to edit their subway floors colour combinations and add/remove them from their collection in order to come up with new sounds, new visuals and new musical compositions.
